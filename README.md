# SQL
I created my first project which is **Data Exploration** using **SQL** where I got a Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths dataset 
from a website called Our World in Data(ourworldindata.org/)which is a scientific online publication that focuses on 
large global problems such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality.
Where I explored the skills like **_Joins, CTEâ€™s, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views and Converting Data Types._**
